Student Career Guidance Platform -

 System documentation (Draft):

    overview - The platform gives post-A-Level students a clear, trustworthy path through the chaos of career decisions.
    it connects them with verified contributors- senior students, alumni and professional.

    the system avoids two extremes;

    1. TURNING DEPARTMENTS INTO COMPLAINT CENTRES
    2. LETTING UNVERIFIED OPINIONS MASQUERADE AS FACT


    THE ARCHITECTURE CREATES A BALANCE: OFFICIAL FACTS REMAIN AUTHORATIVE, WHILE CONTRIBUTORS ADD HUMAN-LEVEL INTERPRETION.


CORE OBJECTIVES:

1. Provide structured career guidance tailored to student's interests 
2. CREATE A TRUSTED environment using contributor verification 
3. reduce misinformation by separating OFFICIAL program data from public discussion 
4. make departments contributors of facts, not emotional managers 
5. Scale effortlessly - new programs, new contributors , new guidance categories. 



USER ROLES:

1. Students - browse
            ask questions 
            save interests
            follow contributors
            view departmental requirements 



2. Verified Contributors - answer questions
                            provide student-level interpretation of official info 
                            maintain a reputation score 
                            get verified through the platform's verification engine 


3. Departments and programs - publish official requirements
                            provide factual guidance content 
                            never engage in dispute resolution 
                            maintain program info pages accessible platfom-wide



System Architecture:

-   Domain Modules

Student Module - Handles student profiles, interests, question history, saved career paths 

Contributor Module - Stores verification status, credentials, activity logs and reputation 

program Module - Holds official department information - Entry requirements
                                                            career paths

FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE;

1. COMPONENT PHILOSOPHY 

components are structured around roles not pages:

- StudentDashboard
-ContributorDashboard
-ProgramOverviewCard
-GuidanceThread
-VerificationStatusBadge 


##everything is reusable, style-consistent and scalable 

 
Navigation Flow::

students ---> Explore programs ----> Ask questions ---> View Responses
Contributors ---> View questions ---> Respond ---> Build reputation
Departments ---> Update Programa Data


WHAT THE TOOL ACTUALLY DOES:

A career simulation lets a student "step into the shoes" of a specific field and see -
    1. the skills needed 
    2. the tasks done in the job 
    3. the typical learning path
    4. the future job prospects 
    5. the personality traits that fit the work 



 its not a predictive machine; its a guided exploration system.



What the student experiences:

imagine clicking "Simulate Software Engineering"

The Tool might show:

    - A mock weekly schedule (lectures, labs, project work) 
    - A typical final-year project 
    - the types of internship students pursue 
    - feedback comparing the career's demands to students chosen interests 



WHY THIS MATTERS:

students often choose careers based on:

- Hype 
- Family pressure
- What their friends are doing 
- Random internet advice (e.g most paying jobs without understanding whats required of them)



I want this to be National University of Science and technology oriented. and branch out later
